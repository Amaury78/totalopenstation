<h2>What it does</h2>

<p>Total Open Station (TOPS) downloads survey data from total
stations on your computer, from almost any operating system.</p>

<p>Data you download can be archived as is, and exported to
exchange formats (CSV, DXF, GeoJSON, ...) for use in CAD or GIS
software.</p>

<p>The program is written with simplicity in mind, it is very
small and fast.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p class="post">Total Open Station is a stand-alone Python application. It
comes already packaged in Debian, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE. Others (including
Windows users) can get it from
the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/totalopenstation">Python
package index</a>, or install it directly with:

<pre>
pip install totalopenstation
</pre>

More detailed instructions are available in the
<a href="http://totalopenstation.readthedocs.org/">user documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Using it</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start the program
<li>connect your total station with a serial or
<em>serial-to-USB cable</em>
<li>insert the serial connection parameters
<li>download data.
</ul>

<p>That's it. You can review raw data immediately, save it to an
ASCII file for later processing, or export directly to an exchange
format.</p>

<p>If you have a lot of data to process, or you're more technically
inclined, the same features are available as command-line programs
or a programming library (just <code>import
totalopenstation</code> in your app).</p>

<h2>My total station doesnâ€™t work with TOPS!</h2>

<p>Your total station model or preferred format is not supported
yet? Total Open Station is <a href="{{ site.github.url }}">open source</a>,
you can help adding it.</p>

would like, <a href="mailto:info@iosa.it">get in touch with us</a>.</p>

<p>Total Open Station is a IOSA project.</p>
