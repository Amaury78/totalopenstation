Total Open Station 0.5 is here!

The application is now based on **Python 3**, which means an improved handling of data transfers and a general improvement of the underlying source code.

An extensive **test suite** based on _[pytest](http://pytest.org/)_ was added to help developers work with more confidence and the documentation was reorganized to be more readable.

There are no visible user changes but this release includes a **large number of bugfixes**, and it is the result of a short and intense development cycle. 

If you were using a previous version of the program you can:

- wait for your Linux distribution to upgrade
- install with `pip install --upgrade totalopenstation` if you know your way around the command line on Linux or MacOS
- download the Windows portable app: this release is the first to support the Windows portable app from the start

But there's more. This release marks a renewed development process and the full onboarding of @psolyca in the team. With the 0.6 release we are planning to move the repository from the personal "steko" account to an organization account and improve the contribution guidelines so that the future of Total Open Station is not dependent on a single person. Of course we have already great plans for new features, as always listed on our issue tracker.

If you use Total Open Station please let us know and maybe give us a star â˜… on GitHub.
