A few days ago I released Total Open Station 0.3.3, to fix [a bug in the Python _wheel_ distribution](https://github.com/steko/totalopenstation/issues/56) of version 0.3.2. There were no further changes in the 0.3 branch and the Python _source_ distribution was not affected by this issue, but it seemed better to tag a new release so that upgrades are handled properly.

The new release is available from PyPI as usual. Thanks to GitHub user @phma for reporting the bug.
