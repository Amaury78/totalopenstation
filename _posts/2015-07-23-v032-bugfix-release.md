Today I'm releasing Total Open Station 0.3.2, a bugfix release over 0.3.1 for [a bug that was preventing users to start TOPS at their first usage](https://github.com/steko/totalopenstation/issues/53) â€’ a showstopper that didn't block two users from reporting the issue. You can get it from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/totalopenstation) as usual.
