title:  "Downloading survey data from a Leica TC307 total station"

Leica TC307 is a rather old model. The one I needed to use a few weeks
ago was set with bytesize 7 unlike later Leica models â€’ although I
will stress again that these settings are not fixed and that most of
the times it is impossible to associate a certain model with correct
default settings. Being in a real hurry to check if the surveyed
points were consistent with earlier measurements, I made good use of
TOPS for downloading and exporting the data.

Downloading from the TC307 is very easy: you plug the data cable in
and power the total station. On GNU/Linux it shows as usual under
`/dev/ttyUSB0`. For some unknown reason I consistently got an error
that the serial port was already open (this also happens rather often
on Windows, I am told). The workaround in Python is very simple: just
close the serial port and then reopen it:

{% highlight python %}
try:
	station.open()
except serial.SerialException:
	station.close()
	station.open()
{% endhighlight %}

TOPS now does the above check for you.

The TC307 exports data in various formats, the best choice is usually
GSI, and Total Open Station 0.4 (development version) has a parser
module for that. Fortunately through this test I could find and
fix an implementation bug in the related code.
