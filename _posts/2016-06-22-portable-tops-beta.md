I've published a prerelease of TOPS 0.4 for users interested in testing a portable app for the Windows platform. That's one file, that is generated with [pyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) and can run from a USB key, or from your desktop, no install needed. It was tested for data processing, and it works, but there may be issues in data transfer: that's why your support for testing is important!

Please [download the app from GitHub](https://github.com/steko/totalopenstation/releases/tag/v0.4.0-beta) and submit any issues you encounter.
