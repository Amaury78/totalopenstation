Last week [pySerial 3.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial/3.0) was released, with many updates and a reworked API.

Total Open Station can download data from your total station thanks to pySerial. This new release doesn't change how TOPS works, and will ultimately improve it, but nevertheless there may be minor annoyances for those installing TOPS right now. Our initial tests with pySerial 3.0 have shown no compatibility issues but there are many devices and operating systems out there!

As always, if anything goes wrong, please [fill a bug report](https://github.com/steko/totalopenstation/issues/).
