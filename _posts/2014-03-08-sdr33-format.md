With commit [83417837](https://bitbucket.org/steko/totalopenstation/commits/834178373e3796e28b01671d34961d2eca59cbd3)
TOPS now supports the SDR33 format for raw data, used by Sokkia.

SDR33 is based on the earlier SDR20, and can contain both raw measurements and cartesian coordinates. For now only
cartesian coordinates are supported. SDR33 support is included in the upcoming 0.4 release.

A typical SDR33 data file looks like this:
