Total Open Station is a program for downloading and processing survey data from total station devices.

.. image:: https://tops.iosa.it/img/totalopenstation-gui.gif

- it is *free/libre open source software*
- it works on *any* operating system where Python is available
- it is designed to support as many devices and formats as possible, all
  within the same program, opposed to having one program per device
- it works both on the command line and with a graphical interface

Total Open Station uses a modular structure and
keeps the downloading of data logically separated from its processing,
thus enabling exporting data to a variety of output formats, even at a
later moment. Archiving of raw data is made easy by using plain text
files.

Installing
==========

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install totalopenstation

Windows users can download the portable app from the 
GitHub `releases page <https://github.com/steko/totalopenstation/releases>`_.
