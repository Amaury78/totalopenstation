====================
 Total Open Station
====================

Total Open Station is a program for downloading and processing survey data from total station devices.

- it is *free/libre open source software*;
- it works on *any* operating system where Python is available;
- it is designed to support as many devices and formats as possible, all
  within the same program, opposed to having one program per device.

Total Open Station uses a modular structure and
keeps the downloading of data logically separated from its processing,
thus enabling exporting data to a variety of output formats, even at a
later moment. Archiving of raw data is made easy by using plain text
files.
